			<p>Religion, Society, and Nature! these are the three struggles of man. They constitute at the same time his three needs. He has need of a faith; hence the temple. He must create; hence the city. He must live; hence the plough and the ship. But these three solutions comprise three perpetual conflicts. The mysterious difficulty of life results from all three. Man strives with obstacles under the form of superstition, under the form of prejudice, and under the form of the elements. A triple <span xml:lang="el">ἁναγκη</span> weighs upon us. There is the fatality of dogmas, the oppression of human laws, the inexorability of nature. In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Notre Dame de Paris</i> the author denounced the first; in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Misérables</i> he exemplified the second; in this book he indicates the third. With these three fatalities mingles that inward fatality⁠—the supreme <span xml:lang="el">ἁναγκη</span>, the human heart.</p>
