<h5>A CERTAIN PREDILECTION</h5>


<p>Gilliatt was a child of Nature. Mess Lethierry was the same.</p>

<p>Lethierry's uncultivated nature, however, was not without
certain refinements.</p>

<p>He was fastidious upon the subject of women's hands. In
his early years, while still a lad, passing from the stage of cabin-boy
to that of sailor, he had heard the Admiral de Suffren say,
"There goes a pretty girl; but what horrible great red hands."
An observation from an admiral on any subject is a command,
a law, an authority far above that of an oracle. The exclamation
of Admiral de Suffren had rendered Lethierry fastidious and
exacting in the matter of small and white hands. His own
hand, a large club fist of the colour of mahogany, was like a
mallet or a pair of pincers for a friendly grasp, and, tightly closed,
would almost break a paving-stone.</p>

<p>He had never married; he had either no inclination for
matrimony, or had never found a suitable match. That, perhaps,
was due to his being a stickler for hands like those of a
duchess. Such hands are, indeed, somewhat rare among the
fishermen's daughters at Portbail.</p>

<p>It was whispered, however, that at Rochefort, on the Charente,
he had, once upon a time, made the acquaintance of a certain
grisette, realising his ideal. She was a pretty girl with graceful
hands; but she was a vixen, and had also a habit of scratching.
Woe betide any one who attacked her! yet her nails, though
capable at a pinch of being turned into claws, were of a cleanliness
which left nothing to be desired. It was these peculiarly
bewitching nails which had first enchanted and then disturbed
the peace of Lethierry, who, fearing that he might one day
become no longer master of his mistress, had decided not to
conduct that young lady to the nuptial altar.</p>

<p>Another time he met at Aurigny a country girl who pleased
him. He thought of marriage, when one of the inhabitants of
the place said to him, "I congratulate you; you will have for
your wife a good fuel maker." Lethierry asked the meaning of
this. It appeared that the country people at Aurigny have a
certain custom of collecting manure from their cow-houses,
which they throw against a wall, where it is left to dry and fall
to the ground. Cakes of dried manure of this kind are used for
fuel, and are called <i>coipiaux</i>. A country girl of Aurigny has no
chance of getting a husband if she is not a good fuel maker;
but the young lady's especial talent only inspired disgust in
Lethierry.</p>

<p>Besides, he had in his love matters a kind of rough country
folks' philosophy, a sailor-like sort of habit of mind. Always
smitten but never enslaved, he boasted of having been in his
youth easily conquered by a petticoat, or rather a <i>cotillon</i>; for
what is now-a-days called a crinoline, was in his time called a
<i>cotillon</i>; a term which, in his use of it, signifies both something
more and something less than a wife.</p>

<p>These rude seafaring men of the Norman Archipelago, have
a certain amount of shrewdness. Almost all can read and write.
On Sundays, little cabin-boys may be seen in those parts, seated
upon a coil of ropes, reading, with book in hand. From all
time these Norman sailors have had a peculiar satirical vein,
and have been famous for clever sayings. It was one of these
men, the bold pilot Quéripel, who said to Montgomery, when he
sought refuge in Jersey after the unfortunate accident in killing
Henry II. at a tournament, with a blow of his lance, "<i>Tête folle
a cassé tête vide</i>." Another one, Touzeau, a sea-captain at St.
Brélade, was the author of that philosophical pun, erroneously
attributed to Camus, "<i>Après la mort, les papes deviennent
papillons, et les sires deviennent cirons</i>."</p>
